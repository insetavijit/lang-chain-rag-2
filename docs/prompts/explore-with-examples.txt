# Topic Exploration Guide

Create a comprehensive document to understand **[TOPIC]**.

## Structure

### 1. Topics Table (at the top)

Start with a table listing all subtopics:

| Topic | Brief |

| [Subtopic Name] | [One-line description] |
| ... | ... |

### 2. For each subtopic

1. **Paragraph** - A clear explanation of what the concept is, why it matters, and when you would use it.

2. **Code Example** - A complete, runnable code block with comments explaining important lines.

## Format

```markdown
# [TOPIC]
